Data and R code accompanying the manuscript: "Fish ID face-off: A comparison of genetic barcoding and otolith shape analysis for streamlining species identification of mesopelagic fishes" submitted to CJFAS

Scripts folder
  * ID-comparison: 
    * Code used to compare the taxonomic identifications generated by DNA barcoding and by otoliths. "Match" as a response means the two identifications methods agree in their taxonomic assignment, "Mismatch" as a response means the two methods do not agree (e.g., DNA assignment of a specimen to Myctophidae and otolith assignment of a specimen to _Diaphus theta_ would constitute a "Mismatch")

  * Geometric-morphometric-analysis: 
    * Procrustes, allometry model, principal component analysis (PCA), disparity analysis, canonical variate analysis (CVA)

  * Site-map:
    * Map of sampled sites using the basemap from Hakai Institute (https://hecate.hakai.org/rguide/mapping-in-r.html#site-maps)


Data folder
  * myct_landmarks.txt = landmark coordinates for each specimen
  * Myct_classifiers.csv = 
     * ID: Specimen identification; 
     * Species: identification assigned to specimen using their otoliths
  * Myct_geneticIDs.csv = the identifications assigned to each specimen based on the DNA barcoding results
  * Myct_otolithIDs.csv = the identifications assigned to each specimen using their otoliths
  * Myct_surveyorIDs.csv = the identifications assigned to each specimen by DFO researchers upon collection of each sample (these IDs were made visually using body morphology and distinguishing features)
  * PCA.RData = PCA output from Geometric-morphometric-analysis (Script)
  * PCSCORES.RData = 
     * PC1: Principal component 1 scores for each specimen; 
     * PC2: Principal component 2 scores for each specimen


Shapefiles folder
